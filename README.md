# Ethernet Protocol Tx channel 



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites



```
Quartus 9.0 or higher```
```

This file contains a brief explanation of each component.
# SEQUENCEUR:
THIS UNIT IS MADE TO CONTROL EVERY SIGNAL COMING 
FROM-TO ALL OTHER UNITS DEPENDING ON THE RESAULT OF EACH UNIT OPERATIONSÂµ
AND COMMAND THE ACTIVATION BY CHANING FLAGS IN FORM OF A SIGNAL

# C3:
THIS UNIT COUNTS THE BYTE NUMBERS OF THE INFOMATION COMING TO FIFO
AND GETS THE SIZE OF THE TRAM THROUGH BYTE 13 AND 14 */ 


# C2 : 
 THIS UNIT COUNTS HOW MANY TIMES THE SHIFT REGISTER 
 GOT SHIFTED AND GENERATE A SIGNAL IF THE PREAMBULE REACHED 144 */

# MANCHESTER ENCODER :
 THIS UNIT CONVERSTS THE TRAM VALUE TO MANCHESTER ENCODING
 0 INTO 01 AND 1 TO 10 */

# MUX :
 A BASIC UNIT MUX(3 INTO 1) THROUGH A 2 BITS VECTOR 

# P_emetteur :
A UNIT THAT GET SENT FIRST AT TRANSMATION OPERATION
WITH A VALUE OF 011001100110010101100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110
 AND ITS ALREADY ENCODED BY MANCHESTER MANUALLY TO REDCUCE NUMBER OF CALCULATIONS


# R_dec (REG1) :
 A REGISTER THAT HOLDS THE SIZE OF THE TRAM COMING 
 TO CONTROL THE START AND THE TRANSMISSION OF TX 

# Reg4 :
A REGISTER THAT HOLDS THE SIZE OF THE TRAM COMING 
TO CONTROL THE START AND THE TRANSMISSION OF TX 
# REGH :
A BASIC REGISTER TO HOLD THE BYTE NUMBER 14 OF DATA COMING FROM FIFO 

# REGL :
 A BASIC REGISTER TO HOLD THE BYTE NUMBER 13 OF DATA COMING FROM FIFO 


# REGOUT :
THIS UNIT IS A SHIFT REGISTER MADE TO HOLD THE PREAMBULE DATA,
REG1 DATA AND TRANSMIT IT THROUGH Tx AS A SERIES DATA 
ALSO GENERATED A SIGNAL SOF WHEN THE TRAM FIRST REACHED THE LOWST BIT
OF THE REGISTERS AND ANOTHER SIGNAL WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS COMPLETED.


## Generic explanation of the components :
THIS UNIT IS MADE TO GET DATA FROM FIFO,
PASS IT INTO MANCHESTER ENCODER,
AND PASS THE RESULT TO A SHIFT REGISTER FOR PARALLER-SERIES CONVERSION 
 CHECKES THE MULTIPLEXOR VALUES AND PASS IT FOR THE TRANSMATION SHIFT REGISTER
DEPENDING ON VALUES OF THE COUNTERS C2 AND C3 AND THE CONDITIONS OF TREATING THE  START AND THE END OF THE INFORMATION
